# Active Context

## Current Focus

Project initialization and setup phase:
- Setting up React + Vite with TypeScript
- Configuring project structure according to the architecture
- Implementing Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- Preparing for chart component implementation

## Next Steps

1. Initialize the project with the required dependencies
2. Set up the directory structure
3. Configure Tailwind CSS with the custom color palette
4. Create basic component scaffolding

## Implementation Approach

Following a modular, component-based architecture with:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Strong typing throughout
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Tailwind styling through @layer
- Zustand for state management

## Current Challenges

- Setting up the proper project structure from the start
- Configuring Tailwind CSS for optimal use with the component architecture
- Planning for efficient data flow between API, hooks, and components
